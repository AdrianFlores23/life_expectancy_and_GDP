# life_expectancy_and_GDP
This project demonstrates key Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques, making it a valuable addition to any data science portfolio.
## Why Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)?
EDA is a crucial step in any data science workflow. Before applying machine learning models or drawing conclusions, it is essential to:
âœ… Understand the structure and quality of the data.
âœ… Identify trends and patterns over time.
âœ… Detect outliers or anomalies that could distort analysis.
âœ… Uncover relationships between variables to generate hypotheses.

By conducting EDA, we ensure that our insights are data-driven and reliable.

## Objectives of This Analysis
1. Trend Analysis: Has Life Expectancy and GDP Increased Over Time?
ðŸ“ˆ We explore whether life expectancy has improved over the years in different countries.
ðŸ“ˆ We analyze GDP trends to see if economies have grown consistently.
ðŸ“Š Visualization: Line charts will be used to illustrate trends over time.

2. Correlation Analysis: Is There a Relationship Between GDP and Life Expectancy?
ðŸ”— Does a higher GDP correlate with a longer life expectancy?
ðŸ”— Are there countries where GDP grew but life expectancy did not?
ðŸ“Š Visualization: Scatter plots with regression lines will help uncover relationships.

3. Distribution Analysis: What Is the Spread of Life Expectancy Across Nations?
ðŸ“Š How does life expectancy vary between countries?
ðŸ“Š Are there extreme values or outliers?
ðŸ“Š Visualization: Histograms and box plots will provide insights into distribution patterns.

## Expected Outcomes
âœ… A clear understanding of how life expectancy and GDP have changed over time.
âœ… Evidence-based insights on the link between economic growth and public health.
âœ… Data-driven visualizations that make trends and patterns easy to understand.
